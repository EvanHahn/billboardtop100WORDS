My
lover
's
got
humor
She
's
the
giggle
at
a
funeral
Knows
everybody
's
disapproval
I
should
've
worshipped
her
sooner
If
the
Heavens
ever
did
speak
She
is
the
last
true
mouthpiece
Every
Sunday
's
getting
more
bleak
A
fresh
poison
each
week
We
were
born
sick
You
heard
them
say
it
My
church
offers
no
absolutes
She
tells
me
worship
in
the
bedroom
The
only
heaven
I
'll
be
sent
to
Is
when
I
'm
alone
with
you
I
was
born
sick
but
I
love
it
Command
me
to
be
well
Amen
amen
amen
Take
me
to
church
I
'll
worship
like
a
dog
at
the
shrine
of
your
lies
I
'll
tell
you
my
sins
So
you
can
sharpen
your
knife
Offer
me
that
deathless
death
Good
God
let
me
give
you
my
life
Take
me
to
church
I
'll
worship
like
a
dog
at

shrine
of
your
lies
I

my
sins
So

sharpen
your
knife
Offer
me
that
deathless
death
Good
God
let
me
give
you
my
life
If
I
'm
a
pagan
of
the
good
times
My
lover
's
the
sunlight
To
keep
the
Goddess
on
my
side
She
demands
a
sacrifice
To
drain
the
whole
sea
get
something
shiny
Something
meaty
for
the
main
course
That
's
a
fine
looking
high
horse
What
you
got
in
the
stable
We
've
a
lot
of
starving
faithful
That
looks
tasty
That
looks
plenty
This
is
hungry
work
Take
me
to
church
I
'll
worship
like
a
dog
at
the
shrine
of
your
lies
I
'll
tell
you
my
sins
So
you
can
sharpen
your
knife
Offer
me
my
deathless
death
Good
God
let
me
give
you
my
life
Take
me
to
church
I
'll
worship
like
a
dog
at
the
shrine
of
your
lies
I
'll
tell
you
my
sins
So
you
can
sharpen
your
knife
Offer
me
my
deathless
death
Good
God
let
me
give
you
my
life
No
masters
or
kings
when
the
ritual
begins
There
is
no
sweeter
innocence
Than
our
gentle
sin
In
the
madness
and
soil
of
that
sad
earthly
scene
Only
then
I
am
human
only
then
I
am
clean
Amen
amen
amen
Take
me
to
church
I
'll
worship
like
a
dog
At
the
shrine
of
your
lies
I
'll
tell
you
my
sins
So
you
can
sharpen
your
knife
Offer
me
that
deathless
death
Good
God
let
me
give
you
my
life
Take
me
to
church
I
'll
worship
like
a
dog
at
the
shrine
of
your
lies
I
'll
tell
you
my
sins
So
you
can
sharpen
your
knife
Offer
me
that
deathless
death
Good
God
let
me
give
you
my
life
When
your
legs
do
n't
work
like
they
used
to
before
And
I
ca
n't
sweep
you
off
of
your
feet
Will
your
mouth
still
remember
the
taste
of
my
love
Will
your
eyes
still
smile
from
your
cheeks
And
darling
I
will
be
loving
you
till
we
're
70
And
baby
my
heart
could
still
fall
as
hard
at
23
And
I
'm
thinking
'bout
how
people
fall
in
love
in
mysterious
ways
Maybe
just
the
touch
of
a
hand
Oh
me
I
fall
in
love
with
you
every
single
day
And
I
just
wan
na
tell
you
I
am
So
honey
now
Take
me
into
your
loving
arms
Kiss
me
under
the
light
of
a
thousand
stars
Place
your
head
on
my
beating
heart
I
'm
thinking
out
loud
That
maybe
we
found
love
right
where
we
are
When
my
hair
's
overgone
and
my
memory
fades
And
the
crowds
do
n't
remember
my
name
When
my
hands
do
n't
play
the
strings
the
same
way
I
know
you
will
still
love
me
the
same
Cause
honey
your
soul
can
never
grow
old
It
's
ever
green
Baby
your
smile
forever
in
my
mind
and
memory
And
I
'm
thinking
'bout
how
people
fall
in
love
in
mysterious
ways
Maybe
it
's
all
part
of
a
plan
I
'll
just
keep
on
making
the
same
mistakes
Hoping
that
you
'll
understand
But
baby
now
Take
me
into
your
loving
arms
Kiss
me
under
the
light
of
a
thousand
stars
Place
your
head
on
my
beating
heart
Thinking
out
loud
That
maybe
we
found
love
right
where
we
are
So
baby
now
Take
me
into
your
loving
arms
Kiss
me
under
the
light
of
a
thousand
stars
Oh
darling
place
your
head
on
my
beating
heart
I
'm
thinking
out
loud
That
maybe
we
found
love
right
where
we
are
Oh

we
found
love
right
where
we
are
And
we
found
love
right
where
we
are

Denying

You

fear
By

us
up
You

'Cause

My
face
above
the
water
My
feet
ca
n't
touch
the
ground
Touch
the
ground
and
it
feels
like
I
can
see
the
sands
on
the
horizon
Everytime
you
are
not
around
I
'm
slowly
drifting
away
drifting
away
Wave
after
wave
wave
after
wave
I
'm
slowly
drifting
drifting
away
And
it
feels
like
I
'm
drowning
Pulling
against
the
stream
Pulling
against
the
stream
I
wish
I
could
make
it
easy
Easy
to
love
me
love
me
But
still
I
reach
to
find
a
way
I
'm
stuck
here
in
between
I
'm
looking
for
the
right
words
to
say
I
'm
slowly
drifting
drifting
away
Wave
after
wave
wave
after
wave
I
'm
slowly
drifting
drifting
away
And
it
feels
like
I
'm
drowning
Pulling
against
the
stream
Pulling
against
the
stream
I
met
this
girl
late
last
year
She
said
Do
n't
you
worry
if
I
disappear
I
told
her
I
'm
not
really
looking
for
another
mistake
I
called
an
old
friend
thinking
that
the
trouble
would
wait
But
then
I
jumped
right
in
a
week
later
returned
I
reckon
she
was
only
looking
for
a
lover
to
burn
But
I
gave
her
my
time
for
two
or
three
nights
Then
I
put
it
on
pause
until
the
moment
was
right
I
went
away
four
months
until
our
paths
crossed
again
She
told
me
I
was
never
looking
for
a
friend
Maybe
you
could
swing
by
my
room
around
ten
Baby
bring
the
lemon
and
a
bottle
of
gin
We
'll
be
in
between
the
sheets
till
the
late
AM
Baby
if
you
wanted
me
then
should
have
just
said
she
's
singing
Do
n't
fuck
with
my
love
That
heart
is
so
cold
All
over
my
arm
I
do
n't
wan
na
know
that
babe
Do
n't
fuck
with
my
love
I
told
her
she
knows
Take
aim
and
reload
I
do
n't
wan
na
know
that
babe
For
a
couple
weeks
I
only
wan
na
see
her
We
drink
away
the
days
with
a
takeaway
pizza
Before
a
text
message
was
the
only
way
to
reach
her
Now
she
's
staying
at
my
place
and
loves
the
way
I
treat
her
Singing
out
all
over
the
track
like
a
feature
And
never
wants
to
sleep
I
guess
that
I
do
n't
want
to
either
But
me
and
her
we
make
money
the
same
way
Four
cities
two
planes
the
same
day
And
those
shows
have
never
been
what
it
's
about
But
maybe
we
'll
go
together
and
just
figure
it
out
I
'd
rather
put
on
a
film
with
you
and
sit
on
a
couch
But
we
should
get
on
a
plane
or
we
'll
be
missing
it
now
Wish
I
'd
have
written
it
down
the
way
that
things
played
out
But
she
was
kissing
him
how
I
was
confused
about
She
should
figure
it
out
while
I
'm
sat
here
singing
Do
n't
fuck
with
my
love
That
heart
is
so
cold
All
over
my
arm
I
do
n't
wan
na
know
that
babe
Do
n't
fuck
with
my
love
I
told
her
she
knows
Take
aim
and
reload
I
do
n't
wan
na
know
that
babe
Knock
knock
knock
on
my
hotel
door
I
do
n't
even
know
if
she
knows
what
for
She
was
crying
on
my
shoulder
but
I
already
told
ya
Trust
and
respect
is
what
we
do
this
for
I
never
intended
to
be
next
But
you
did
n't
need
to
take
him
to
bed
that
's
all
And
I
never
saw
him
as
a
threat
Until
you
disappeared
with
him
to
have
sex
of
course
It
's
not
like
we
were
both
on
tour
We
were
staying
on
the
same
fucking
hotel
floor
And
I
was
n't
looking
for
a
promise
or
commitment
But
it
was
never
just
fun
and
I
thought
you
were
different
This
is
not
the
way
you
realized
what
you
wanted
It
's
a
bit
too
much
too
late
if
I
'm
honest
All
this
time
God
knows
I
'm
singing
Do
n't
fuck
with
my
love
That
heart
is
so
cold
All
over
my
arm
I
do
n't
wan
na

Do

Going
out
tonight
Changes
into
something
red
Her
mother
does
n't
like
that
kind
of
dress
Everything
she
never
had
She
's
showing
off
Driving
too
fast
Moon
is
breaking
through
her
hair
She
's
heading
for
something
that
she
wo
n't
forget
Having
no
regrets
is
all
that
she
really
wants
We
're
only
getting
older
baby
And
I
've
been
thinking
about
it
lately
Does
it
ever
drive
you
crazy
Just
how
fast
the
night
changes
Everything
that
you
've
ever
dreamed
of
Disappearing
when
you
wake
up
But
there
's
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
Even
when
the
night
changes
It
will
never
change
me
and
you
Chasing
it
tonight
doubts
are
running
‘round
her
head
He
's
waiting
hides
behind
a
cigarette
Heart
is
beating
loud
she
does
n't
want
it
to
stop
Moving
too
fast
Moon
is
lighting
up
her
skin
She
's
falling
does
n't
even
know
it
yet
Having
no
regrets
is
all
that
she
really
wants
We
're
only
getting
older
baby
And
I
've
been
thinking
about
it
lately
Does
it
ever
drive
you
crazy
Just
how

the

changes
Everything
that
you
've

wake
up
But
there
's
nothing
to
be

of
Even
when
the

It
will
never
change
me
and
you
Going
out
tonight
Changes
into
something
red
Her
mother
does
n't
like
that
kind
of
dress
Reminds
her
of
a
missing
piece
of
innocence
she
lost
We
're
only
getting
older
baby
And
I
've
been
thinking
about
it
lately
Does
it
ever
drive
you

Just

was
coming
through
These

sitting
on
the
wall
They
watch
every
move

make
Bright
light
living

Your
cold
heart
makes
my
spirit
shake
I
had
to
go
through
hell
to
prove
I
'm
not
insane
Had
to
meet
the
devil
just
to
know
his
name
And
that
's
when
my
love
was
burning
Yeah

's
still
burning

pain
And
at
most
I
'm
sleeping
all
these
demons
away
But
your
ghost
the
ghost
of
you
it
keeps
me
awake
He
said
I
've
been
where
you
've
been
before
Down
every
hallway
's
a
slamming
door
No
way
out
no
one
to
come
and
save
me
Wasting
a
life
that
the
Good
Lord
gave
you
There
's
somebody
saying
what
I
'm
saying
to
you
Open
my
eyes
and
told
me
truth
He
said
just
a
little
faith
and
it
'll
all
get
better
So
I
followed
that
preacher
man
down
to
the
river
and
now
I
'm
changed
And
now
I
'm
stronger
There
must
've
been
something
in
the
water
Oh
there
must
've
been
something
in
the
water
Well
I
heard
what
he
said
and
I
went
on
my
way
Did
n't
think
about
it
for
a
couple
of
days
Then
it
hit
me
like
a
lightning
late
one
night
I
was
all
out
of
hoping
all
out
of
fight
Could
n't
fight
back
my
tears
so
I
fell
on
my
knees
Saying
God
if
you
're
there
come
and
rescue
me
Fell
all
pouring
down
from
my
dress
Got
ta
wash
in
the
water
wash
in
the
blur
and
now
I
'm
changed
And
now
I
'm
stronger
There
must
've
been
something
in
the
water
Oh
there
must
've
been
something
in
the
water
And
now
I
'm
singing
all
along
to
amazing
race
Ca
n't
nobody
wipe
this
smile
off
my
face
Got
joy
in
my
heart
angels
on
my
side
Thinking
about
it
I
saw
the
heart
and
looked
their
head
No
turning
back
leave
everyday
give
it
all
that
I
have
Trusted
someone
bigger
than
me
Ever
since
the
day
that
I
believed
I
am
changed
And
now
I
'm
stronger
There
must
be
been
something
in
the
water
Oh
there
must
be
something
in
the
water
Oh
there
must
be
something
in
the
water
Oh
there
must
be
something
in
the
water
Oh
yeah
I
'm
stronger
Stronger
I
'm
free
Horses
are
running
wide
open
I
just
got
ta
ride
To
those
honky-tonk
bars
that
stay
open
way
past
closing
time
Songs
about
free
thinkin
and
drinking
sure
light
my
fire
That
flame
leaves
a
scar
on
my
heart
like
an
old
branding
iron
Chorus
She
said
rodeo
man
where
are
you
going
Do
n't
you
know
that
the
life
of
a
cowboy
is
no
good
alone
If
you
tear
down
that
fence
of
rusty
barbed
wire
Then
I
'll
lay
down
beside
you
and
be
your
shotgun
rider
Yesterday
's
nothing
but
dust
I
brush
off
my
boots
While
I
'm
wearing
out
roads
do
n't
you
know
that
I
'm
sure
missing
you
If
I
leave
you
'll
be
wondering
when
I
'll
be
back
again
Between
Texas
and
ranchers
and
old
friends
where
do
you
fit
in
Chorus
Chorus
We
're
a

But

as
you
are
with
me
there
's
no
place
I
'd
rather
be
I
would
wait
forever
exalted
in
the
scene
As
long
as
I
am
with
you
my
heart
continues
to
beat
With
every
step
we
take
Kyoto
to
The
Bay
Strolling
so
casually
We
're
different
and
the
same
gave
you
another
name
Switch
up
the
batteries
If
you
gave
me
a
chance
I
would
take
it
It
's
a

to
find
our
inner
peace
Make
it
everlasting
so
nothing
's
incomplete
It
's
easy
being
with
you
sacred
simplicity
As

away
from

I

Your

We

Caused

Cleaned
it
up

running
Daddy

old
Winnebago
Wing
and
a
prayer

Five

I

When

it
To
Talladega
boys
raised
up
Whiskey
in
your
glass
here
's
to
turning
up
Slowing
down
and
cars
that
go
real
fast
We
were
laughing
and
living
drinking
and
wishing
And
thinking
as
that
checkered
flag
was
waving
Sure
would
like
to
stay
in
Talladega
Like
a
storm
time
rolls
on
You
ca
n't
hit
pause
as
we
just
did
Most
days
in
life
do
n't
stand
out
But
life
's
about
those
days
that
will
like
Rocking
rando
getting
rowdy
Shooting
roman
candles
at
the
man
in
the
moon
til
the
Alabama
sun
was
breaking
Over
Talladega

Talladega
When
the
winds
go
cold
and
it
blows
October
I
think
about
us
shoulder
to
shoulder
Like
those
cars
my
thoughts
roll
over
and
over
and
over
In
my
mind
Tonight
I

And
your

Bourbon
on

Smooth
with
a
kick
A
chill
and
a
burn
all
At
the
same
time
She
's
Sunday
drive
meets
High
speed
chase
She
ai
n't
just
a
song
She
's
the
whole
mix
tape
She
's
so
complicated
That
's
the
way
God
made
her
Sunshine
mixed
with
A
little
hurricane
Woah-oh-oh
And
she
destroys
me
in
that
t-shirt
And
I

fall

this
She

That
girl
right
there
's
The
perfect
storm
I

how
to
make
her
laugh
Or
blush
or
mad
at
me
But
that
's
OK
there
ai
n't
no
one
More
beautiful
angry
And
she
loves
just
as
deep
As
she
goes
when
she
's
down
The
highs
match
the
lows
Ca
n't
have
one
without
the
other
And
I
love
her
just
the
way
God
made
her
Sunshine
mixed
with
A
little
hurricane
And
she
destroys
me
in
that
t-shirt
And
I
love
her
so
much
it
hurts
I
never

There

Since

So

Ever
since
you

I
've
been
ridin
'round
cranking
up
a
little
country
gold
heartbreak
Cried
and
dried
these
tears
I
do
n't
know
how
much
more
missin
you

For

It
's
about

There’s
a
neon
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
It
ain’t
all
that
bright
but
even
though
it’s
subtle
It’s
got
me
feeling
alright
gon

make
it
a

There’s

I
take
a
shot
of
I
do
n't
care
what
you
're
doing
now
Chase
that
one
with
a
cold
screw
you
When
that
's
done
I
just
might
wash
it
down
With
a
big
pitcher
of
someone
new
That

At
the
bar

See

When

I

forever
Even

pain
would
never
end
They

the
night
's
darkest
just
before
the
dawn
Gets
kissed
by

Do
you
ever
think
of
me
when
you
lie
Lie
down
in
your
bed
your
bed
of
lies
And
I
knew
better
than
to
look
in
your
eyes
They
only
pretend
you
will
be
mine
And
you
know
how
you
made
me
believe
You
had
me
caught
in
every
web
that
you
weaved
But
do
you
ever
think
of
me
when
you
lie
Lie
down
in
your
bed
your
bed
of
lies
You
could
never
make
eye
contact
Everything
you
got
was
based
off
of
my
contacts
You
a
fraud
but
I'mma
remain
icon-stat
Balenciaga
's
on
my
boots
with
the
python
strap
You
was
caught
up
in
the
rush
and
you
was
caught
up
in
the
thrill
of
it
You
was
with
me
way
before
I
hit
a
quarter
mil
in
it
Put
you
in
the
crib
and
you
ai
n't
never
pay
a
bill
in
it
I
was
killin
it
man
you
got
me
poppin
pills
in
it
I
told
Baby
hit
you
I
said
this
nigga
buggin
Cause
I
was
doing
it
for
us
I
told
em
fuck
the
public
Could
n't
believe
that
I
was
home
alone
contemplating
Overdosin
no
more
postin
no
more
toastin
over
oceans
They
say
you
do
n't
know
what
you
got
'til
it
's
gone
They
say
that
your
darkest
hour
comes
before
your
dawn
But
there
was
something
I
should
've
asked
all
along
I'mma
ask
on
the
song
Do
you
ever
think
of
me
when
you
lie
Lie
down
in
your
bed
your
bed
of
lies
And
I
knew
better
than
to
look
in
your
eyes
They
only
pretend
you
will
be
mine
And
you
know
how
you
made
me
believe
You
had
me
caught
in
every
web
that
you
weaved
But
do
you
ever
think
of
me
when
you
lie
Lie
down
in
your
bed
your
bed
of
lies
I
just
figured
if
you
saw
me
if
you
looked
in
my
eyes
You
'd
remember
our
connection
and
be
freed
from
the
lies
I
just
figured
I
was
something
that
you
could
n't
replace
But
there
was
just
a
blank
stare
and
I
could
n't
relate
I
just
could
n't
understand
and
I
could
n't
defend
What
we
had
what
we
shared
and
I
could
n't
pretend
When
the
tears
roll
down
it
's
like
you
ai
n't
even
notice
em
If
you
had
a
heart
I
was
hoping
you
would
've
showed
it
some
What
the
fuck
you
really
telling
me
what
you
telling
me
I
could
tell
you
lying
get
the
fuck
out
do
n't
yell
at
me
I
ai
n't
mean
to
cut
you
I
ai
n't
want
to
catch
a
felony
This
ai
n't
How
To
Be
A
Player
you
ai
n't
Bill
Bellamy
They
say
you
do
n't
know
what
you
got
till
it
's
gone
They
said
that
your
darkest
hour
came
before
your
dawn
But
there
was
something
that
I
should
've
asked
all
along
I'mma
ask
on
the
song
So
does
she
know
I
've
been
in
that
bed
before
A
thousand
count
and
not
a
single
threaded
truth
If
I
was
just
another
girl
Then
I
'm
ashamed
to
say
that
I
'm
not
over
you
There
's
one
thing
I
need
to
know
So
call
me
when
you
're
not
so
busy
just
thinking
of
yourself
Do
you
ever
think
of
me
when
you
lie
Lie
down
in
your
bed
your
bed
of
lies
And
I
knew
better
than
to
look
in
your
eyes
They
only
pretend
you
will
be
mine
And
you
know
how
you
made
me
believe
You
had
me
caught
in
every
web
that
you
weaved
But
do
you
ever
think
of
me
when
you

Lie

do
n't
know
if
you
were
looking
at
me
or

You

all
the
time
And
I
do
n't
mean
to
bother
you
but
I
could
n't
just
walk
by
And
not
say
hi
And
I
know
your
name
Cause
everybody
in
here
knows
your
name
And
you
're
not
looking
for
anything
right
now
So
I
do
n't
wan
na
come
on
strong
But
do
n't
get
me
wrong
Your
eyes
are
so
intimidating
My
heart
is
pounding
but
It
's
just
a
conversation
No
girl
I
'm
not
gunna
waste
it
You
do
n't
know
me
I
do
n't
know
you
but
I
want
to
I
do
n't
wan
na
steal
your
freedom
I
do
n't
wan
na

your
mind
I
do
n't
have
to
make
you
love
me
I
just
want
to
take
your
time
I
do
n't
wan
na
wreck
your
Friday
I

gunna
waste
my
lies
I
do
n't
have
to
take
your
heart
I
just
wan
na
take
your
time
And
I
know
it
starts
with
hello
And
the
next
thing
you
know
your
trying
to
be
nice
And
some
guys
getting
too
close
Tryin
to
pick
you
up
Trying
to
get
you
drunk
And
I
'm
sure
one
of
your
friends
is
about
to
come
over
here
Cause
she
's
supposed
to
save
you
from
random
guys
That
talk
to
much
and
wan
na
stay
too
long
It
's
the
same
old
song
and
dance
but
I
think
you
know
it
well
You
coulda
rolled
your
eyes
Told
me
to
go
to
hell
Coulda
walked
away
But
your
still
here
And
I
'm
still
here
Come
on
let
's
see
where
it
goes
I

your
freedom
I

n't
wan

your
mind
I

have
to
make
you
love
me
I
just
wan
na
take
your
time
I
do
n't
have
to
meet
your
mother
We
do
n't
have
to
cross
that
line
I
do
n't
wan
na
steal
your
covers
I
just
wan
na
take
your
time
I
do
n't
wan
na

home
with
you
I
just
wan

be
alone
with

I

freedom
I
do
n't
wan
na

your
mind
I

you
love
me
I
just
wan
na

your
time
I
do
n't
wan
na
blow
your
phone
up
I
just
wan

your
mind
I
do

I
just
wan

your
time
No
I

you
baby
And
I
ai
n't
got
ta
call
you
mine
I
do
n't
have
to
take
your
heart
I
just
wan
na
take
your
time
I
'm
a
princess
cut
from
marble
smoother
than
a
storm
And
the
scars
that
mark
my
body
they
're
silver
and
gold
My
blood
is
a
flood
of
rubies
precious
stones
It
keeps
my
veins
hot
the
fires
find
a
home
in
me
I
move
through
town
I’m
quiet
like
a
fight
And
my
necklace
is
of
rope
I
tie
it
and
untie
it
And
now
people
talk
to
me
but
nothing
ever
hits
home
People
talk
to
me
and
all
the
voices
just
burn
holes
I’m
done
with
it
ooh
This
is
the
start
of
how
it
ever
ends
They
used
to
shout
my
name
now
they
whisper
it
I
'm
speeding
up
and
this
is
the
Red
orange
yellow
flicker
beat
sparking
up
my
heart
We’re
at
the
start
the
colors
disappear
I
never
watch
the
stars
there’s
so
much
down
here
So
I
just
try
to
keep
up
with
the
Red
orange
yellow
flicker
beat
sparking
up
my
heart
I
dream
all
year
but
they
're
not
the
sweet
kinds
And
the
shivers
move
down
my
shoulder
blades
in
double
time
And
now
people
talk
to
me
I
'm
slipping
out
of
reach
now
People
talk
to
me
and
all
their
faces
blur
But
I
got
my
fingers
laced
together
and
I
made
a
little
prison
And
I
'm
locking
up
everyone
who
ever
laid
a
finger
on
me
I’m
done
with
it
ooh
This
is
the
start
of
how
it
ever
ends
They
used
to
shout
my
name
now
they
whisper
it
I
'm
speeding
up
and
this
is
the
Red
orange
yellow
flicker
beat
sparking
up
my
heart
We’re
at
the
start
the
colors
disappear
I
never
watch
the
stars
there’s
so
much
down
here
So
I
just
try
to
keep
up
with
the
Red
orange
yellow
flicker
beat
sparking
up
my
heart
And
this
is
the
Red
orange
yellow
flicker
beat
sparking
up
my
heart
And
this
is
the
Red
orange
yellow
flicker
beat-beat-beat-beat
We
all
want
what
we
ai
n't
got
Our
favorite
doors
are
always
locked
On
a
higher
hill
with
a
taller
top
We
all
want
what
we
ai
n't
got
We
ai
n't
happy
where
we
are
There
's
greener
grass
in
the
neighbors
yard
A
bigger
house
and
a
faster
car
We
ai
n't
happy
where
we
are
All
I
want
is
what
I
had
I
'll
trade
it
all
just
to
get
her
back
She
's
moving
on
But
I
guess
I
'm
not
We
all
want
what
we
ai
n't
got
We
all
wish
it
did
n't
hurt
When
you
try
your
best
but
it
does
n't
work
And
goodbye
's
such
a
painful
word
We
all
wish
it
did
n't
hurt
All
I
want
is
what
I
had
See
I
'd
trade
it
all
just
to
get
her
back
She
's
moving
on
But
I
guess
I
'm
not
We
all
want
what
we
ai
n't
got
We
all
want
what
we
ai
n't
got
We
all
want
what
we
ai
n't
got
You
see
I
wanted
the
world
until
my
whole
world
stopped
A
love
like
that
ai
n't
easily
forgot
We
all
want
what
we
ai
n't
got
Can
you
feel
it
Now
it
's
coming
back
we
can
steal
it
If
we
bridge
this
gap
I
can
see
you
Through
the
curtains
of
the
waterfall
When
I
lost
it
Yeah
you
held
my
hand
But
I
tossed
it
Did
n't
understand
You
were
waiting
As
I
dove
into
the
waterfall
So

Bombs

Say
Geronimo
Well
we
rushed
it
Moving
way
too
fast
And
we
crushed
it
But
it
's
in
the
past
We
can
make
this
leap
Through
the
curtains
of
the
waterfall
So

Well
I
'm
just
a
boy
With
a
broken
toy
All
lost
and
coy
At
the
curtains
of
the
waterfall
So
it
's
here
I
stand
As
a
broken
man
But
I
've
found
my
friend
At
the
curtains
of
the
waterfall
Now
I
'm
falling
down
Through
the
crashing
sound
And
you
've
come
around
At
the
curtains
of
the
waterfall
And
you
rushed
to
me
And
it
sets
us
free
So
I
fall
to
my
knees
At
the
curtains
of
the
waterfall
So

Can
you
feel
my
love
The
joke
's
on
me
and
it
ai
n't
funny
Everybody
but
me
could
see
the
punch
line
coming
a
mile
away
I
've
heard
it
so
many
times
I
can
tell
it
to
the
T
Believe
me
I
could
sell
it
all
day
It
goes
A
guy
walks
into
a
bar
orders
a
drink
Sees
a
girl
that
catches
his
eye
Asks
her
if
she
wants
another
They
fall
for
each
other
and
end
up
lovers
They
laugh
cry
hold
on
tight
make
it
work
for
a
little
while
Then
one
night
her
taillights
fade
out
into
the
dark
And
a
guy
walks
into
a
bar
I
'd
laugh
too
if
my
heart
would
let
me
Keeping
it
light
will
probably
help
to
get
me
over
you
I
